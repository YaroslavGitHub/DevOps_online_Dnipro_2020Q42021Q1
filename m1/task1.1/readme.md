# Task 1.1

## Review about GIT

- Created branches (main, develop, images & styles) that imitates Teamwork in the simplest project

- Each branch allows independent teamwork. Branch **images** could used by frontend specialist, **styles** - for designer, **develop** for tests and **main** it is for customer uses.

## My opinion about DevOps

I think it is connecting link between various project participants. Person that responsible for product release, support and updates is _DevOps engineer_. The goal of DevOps is to improve development process. So if DevOps process works correctly we wll be receiving great result: excellent work, minimized errors and satisfied customer feedback.
